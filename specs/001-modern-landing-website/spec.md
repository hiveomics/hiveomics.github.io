# Feature Specification: Modern Startup Landing Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-modern-landing-website`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I am building a modern startup company landing website. I want it to look sleek, something that would stand out. Should have a landing page showcasing our main product: you can find product information in the confluence pages # 405864449 and # 395739137. Also it should contain About, FAQ and Careers pages and a Blog subdivision - with one featured blog post and a list of other blog posts. Should have 10 blog posts, and the data is mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real feed."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Product Discovery Landing Page (Priority: P1)

A potential customer or hospital decision-maker visits the website to understand what Nexus (the product) does and evaluate whether it solves their radiology workflow challenges. They need to quickly understand the value proposition, key features, and benefits of the AI-powered radiology governance system.

**Why this priority**: The landing page is the primary entry point and first impression. Without a compelling landing page that clearly communicates the product value, all other pages are irrelevant. This is the foundation that drives all conversion and engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the homepage and verifying all product information is displayed correctly, including value proposition, key features (autonomous pre-triage, in-exam QA, guideline compliance tracking), primary user types (radiologists, administrators, leadership), and clear calls-to-action for learning more or requesting a demo.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see a clear headline describing Nexus as a radiology workflow governance system with AI-powered quality assurance
2. **Given** a visitor is on the homepage, **When** they scroll through the page, **Then** they see the four main functions: Document & Procedure Governance, Autonomous Triage, Diagnostic Tactics, and In-Exam QA & Safety Watcher
3. **Given** a visitor wants to understand outcomes, **When** they view the benefits section, **Then** they see measurable outcomes like "100% autonomous pre-triage coverage" and ">95% critical issue detection"
4. **Given** a visitor wants to take action, **When** they scroll to the call-to-action, **Then** they see prominent buttons to "Request Demo" or "Learn More"
5. **Given** a healthcare decision-maker visits, **When** they review the page, **Then** they understand which user types benefit (radiologists, CMOs, technologists, administrators)

---

### User Story 2 - Blog Content Discovery (Priority: P2)

A visitor interested in medical imaging AI, radiology workflow optimization, or healthcare technology trends wants to explore thought leadership and educational content. They need to discover relevant blog posts, with one featured post prominently displayed and easy access to additional articles.

**Why this priority**: Blog content establishes thought leadership, improves SEO, and nurtures leads through educational content. It's the second priority because it supports conversion but isn't required for initial product discovery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the blog section and verifying a featured post is prominently displayed with an image, title, excerpt, and read time, plus a grid of 9 additional blog posts with similar metadata. All blog posts should have mock titles related to radiology AI, workflow optimization, and healthcare technology.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor navigates to the blog section, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a featured blog post with a large image, compelling title, excerpt, author, date, and estimated read time
2. **Given** a visitor wants to explore more content, **When** they scroll past the featured post, **Then** they see a grid of 9 additional blog posts with thumbnails, titles, excerpts, and metadata
3. **Given** a visitor finds an interesting post, **When** they click on any blog post card, **Then** they navigate to the full blog post page (mock destination acceptable for MVP)
4. **Given** a visitor wants to filter content, **When** they view the blog listing, **Then** they see category tags or topics (e.g., "AI in Radiology", "Clinical Workflows", "Quality Assurance")
5. **Given** a visitor reads the featured post, **When** they finish, **Then** they see a call-to-action to explore related posts or request a demo

---

### User Story 3 - Company Information & Trust Building (Priority: P3)

A prospect evaluating Nexus wants to understand the company behind the product, including mission, team expertise, and company values. This builds trust and credibility before making a purchasing or partnership decision.

**Why this priority**: About page information is important for building trust but typically comes after initial product interest. Visitors usually explore the product first, then validate the company behind it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the About page and verifying presence of company mission statement, team descriptions or leadership profiles, company values, and founding story. Content should emphasize expertise in medical imaging AI and regulatory compliance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor navigates to the About page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a compelling mission statement about improving radiology quality and patient safety through AI
2. **Given** a prospect wants to validate expertise, **When** they scroll through the About page, **Then** they see team member profiles or leadership bios highlighting relevant medical AI and radiology experience
3. **Given** a visitor wants to understand company values, **When** they review the page, **Then** they see clearly stated values related to clinical safety, transparency, and quality
4. **Given** a healthcare organization evaluating vendors, **When** they visit the About page, **Then** they see information about regulatory compliance (HIPAA, FDA 510(k)) and quality standards (ISO 13485)
5. **Given** a visitor finishes reading, **When** they reach the page end, **Then** they see a call-to-action to contact the team or request a demo

---

### User Story 4 - Frequently Asked Questions (Priority: P4)

A prospect or evaluator has specific questions about how Nexus works, pricing, implementation, integration, and compliance. They need quick answers to common questions without scheduling a call or demo.

**Why this priority**: FAQ pages reduce friction in the sales process by answering common objections and questions, but visitors typically access this after initial interest is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the FAQ page and verifying presence of at least 10-15 questions organized by category (Product Features, Implementation, Security & Compliance, Pricing, Support), with expandable/collapsible answers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor navigates to the FAQ page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see questions organized into logical categories like Product Features, Implementation, Security & Compliance, and Pricing
2. **Given** a visitor has a specific question, **When** they click on a question, **Then** the answer expands to show detailed information while other questions remain collapsed
3. **Given** a hospital IT team evaluates integration, **When** they review the FAQ, **Then** they find answers about PACS/RIS integration, DICOM support, and existing system compatibility
4. **Given** a CMO evaluates compliance, **When** they search the FAQ, **Then** they find answers about HIPAA compliance, FDA clearance status, and audit capabilities
5. **Given** a visitor doesn't find their answer, **When** they reach the FAQ page end, **Then** they see a call-to-action to contact support or schedule a consultation

### User Story 5 - Career Opportunities & Talent Acquisition (Priority: P5)

A prospective candidate (e.g., ML engineer, clinical specialist, software developer) wants to explore career opportunities at the company. They need to see available positions, understand company culture, and apply to open roles.

**Why this priority**: Careers page is important for company growth but has the lowest immediate impact on customer acquisition and product validation. It's essential for scaling the team but secondary to product marketing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the Careers page and verifying presence of company culture description, employee benefits overview, and a list of open positions (3-5 mock positions) with job titles, locations, and brief descriptions, plus an application mechanism.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a prospective candidate visits the Careers page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a compelling description of the company culture and mission
2. **Given** a candidate wants to understand benefits, **When** they review the page, **Then** they see information about benefits, work environment (remote/hybrid options), and growth opportunities
3. **Given** a job seeker wants to explore roles, **When** they scroll to the positions section, **Then** they see 3-5 open positions with titles like "Senior ML Engineer", "Clinical Product Specialist", "Full-Stack Developer"
4. **Given** a candidate finds a relevant position, **When** they click on a job listing, **Then** they see detailed job description, requirements, and responsibilities (mock content acceptable)
5. **Given** a candidate wants to apply, **When** they view a position, **Then** they see a clear "Apply Now" button or application form link

- How does the website handle slow internet connections? Page must load core content within 3 seconds on 3G connection per constitution requirements.
- What happens when a visitor navigates directly to a blog post URL? They should see a consistent header/footer with navigation back to main sections.
- How does the system handle screen readers and keyboard navigation? All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible per WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- What happens when browser JavaScript is disabled? Core content should still be visible as static HTML.
- How does the website appear in older browsers (e.g., IE11)? Should gracefully degrade while remaining functional per browser compatibility requirements.

### User Story 6 - Legal Compliance & Transparency (Priority: P6)

A website visitor or potential customer needs to understand how their data is handled and what terms govern the use of the website. Legal pages provide transparency, build trust, and ensure regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

**Why this priority**: Legal pages are required for regulatory compliance and professional credibility, but visitors typically access them only when needed for evaluation or legal review. They're essential for launch but don't drive initial product discovery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages from footer links and verifying presence of standard legal sections with proper formatting, last updated dates, and contact information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor is on any page, **When** they scroll to the footer, **Then** they see links to "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service"
2. **Given** a visitor clicks the Privacy Policy link, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a properly formatted legal document with sections for data collection, usage, sharing, cookies, and user rights
3. **Given** a visitor clicks the Terms of Service link, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a properly formatted legal document with sections for acceptable use, intellectual property, disclaimers, and limitations of liability
4. **Given** a compliance officer reviews legal pages, **When** they examine the content, **Then** they see last updated date, effective date, and contact email for legal inquiries
5. **Given** a visitor reads a legal page, **When** they scroll through sections, **Then** they see clear hierarchical organization with section headings and sub-sections

### Assumptions

- Static website with no backend required (per constitution)
- All blog post content will be mock data stored locally (no CMS or external feed integration)
- Job application links can point to placeholder/external application system (e.g., "mailto:" or "#")
- Contact form submissions can be handled via third-party service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms) or simple mailto links for MVP
- Product screenshots or demo videos are not required for MVP; text descriptions and iconography are sufficient
- Legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) MUST be fully implemented with industry-standard content appropriate for a healthcare SaaS company (UPDATED)
- No user authentication, login, or personalization required
- Analytics integration (Google Analytics, Plausible) is desired but not blocking for initial deployment
- Design system/component library selection is implementation decision (could use Tailwind, Bootstrap, custom CSS, etc.)
- Build tooling selection is implementation decision (could use Vite, Webpack, Parcel, or simple HTML/CSS/JS)
