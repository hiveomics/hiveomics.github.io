## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on WHAT the website needs (pages, content, features) without specifying HOW to build it (no mention of React, Vue, Tailwind, etc.). Implementation decisions are explicitly documented in Assumptions as "implementation decision."

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate the visitor's goals (understanding product, exploring content, validating company, finding answers, exploring careers) and the business value (conversion, SEO, trust, lead nurturing, talent acquisition).

✅ **Non-technical language**: The spec is written in plain language that business stakeholders, marketers, and product managers can understand without technical expertise.

✅ **All mandatory sections present**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (with Functional Requirements and Key Entities), and Success Criteria (with Measurable Outcomes) are all completed.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: The spec contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are clearly defined with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Every functional requirement can be verified through inspection or testing:
- FR-001: Can verify landing page displays all specified elements
- FR-007: Can verify blog post cards display all required metadata
- FR-015: Can test accessibility with automated tools (WAVE, axe)
- FR-018: Can measure Lighthouse scores

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 3 seconds on 3G connection"
- SC-002: "Lighthouse score of 90+"
- SC-004: "zero critical violations"
- SC-007: "at least 30% reduction"

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: All success criteria focus on user/business outcomes without mentioning implementation:
- No mention of specific frameworks, libraries, or tools
- Focuses on measurable outcomes (load time, scores, browser compatibility)
- Uses industry-standard metrics (Lighthouse, WCAG, Core Web Vitals)

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: All 5 user stories include detailed acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format with multiple scenarios per story (3-5 scenarios each).

✅ **Edge cases identified**: Six edge cases are documented covering mobile responsiveness, slow connections, direct navigation, accessibility, JavaScript-disabled scenarios, and browser compatibility.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: The spec clearly defines what's included (static website, 5 main pages, mock blog content) and what's deferred (CMS integration, real blog feed, authentication, backend functionality).

✅ **Assumptions documented**: The Assumptions section explicitly documents 10 assumptions about static architecture, mock data, placeholder links, form handling, design/build tooling decisions, and optional features like analytics.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Functional requirements have acceptance criteria**: Each FR is testable and maps to user stories. For example:
- FR-001-002 map to User Story 1 acceptance scenarios
- FR-006-009 map to User Story 2 acceptance scenarios
- FR-005, FR-019 map to User Story 4 acceptance scenarios

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: The 5 prioritized user stories cover all main visitor journeys:
- P1: Product discovery (landing page) - most critical
- P2: Content exploration (blog)
- P3: Company validation (about)
- P4: Question resolution (FAQ)
- P5: Talent acquisition (careers)

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: The spec includes 15 measurable success criteria covering performance (SC-001, SC-009), quality (SC-002, SC-010), accessibility (SC-004, SC-005), browser compatibility (SC-003), and deployability (SC-011, SC-012).

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The spec maintains strict separation between WHAT (requirements) and HOW (implementation). Build tools, frameworks, and technical approaches are explicitly noted as "implementation decisions" in Assumptions.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for planning

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready to proceed to the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). All quality gates have been met:

- Clear user value articulated through 5 prioritized user stories
- 20 testable functional requirements with no ambiguity
- 15 measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Comprehensive edge cases and assumptions documented
- Zero clarification markers needed
- Maintains business/user focus without implementation details

## Notes

The specification successfully integrates product information from the Confluence pages (Nexus product vision and system concept) into user-facing content requirements while maintaining appropriate abstraction for a static landing website. The constitution's static-first architecture, performance budget, and accessibility standards are directly reflected in the functional requirements and success criteria.

No spec updates required - proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` as needed.
